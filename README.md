This is a repository for testing an item based recommendation system built on top of the Knnbaseline model from the surprise library. 
The repository contains a preprocessing code as well as the API deployement in FasstAPI.


The KNNbaseline model is built on a 400k filtered and based on most important rows, left with 200k row for training.




The dataset is the Amazon Review Data from the year 2018.


In this example I have proceeded with the Softwares category dataset, this is a link to it:
